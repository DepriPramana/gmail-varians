## Overview

Gmail treats email addresses with or without dots the same. For instance, `<example@gmail.com>` and `<ex.ample@gmail.com>` both point to the same inbox.

This repository contains a web application that generates all possible Gmail dot variations for a given address. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a simple and interactive user experience.

## How to Use

1. Go to the [Gmail Dot Trick Generator](https://depripramana.github.io/gmail-varians/).
2. Enter your Gmail address in the input field.
3. Click the **Generate** button.
4. View the list of dot-based variations of your email.
5. Use any of the generated addresses—they’ll all deliver emails to your original inbox.
